        <h1>The BLACKFISH Effect</h1>
    
        <p> The release of 2013's documentary smash-hit BLACKFISH prompts protests of SeaWorld's handling of marine animals. But how will it effect the company?</p>
        
        <p> The program depicts the adventures of the Doctor, a Time Lord—a time-travelling humanoid alien. He explores the universe in his TARDIS, a sentient time-travelling space ship. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Along with a succession of companions, the Doctor faces a variety of foes while working to save civilizations, help ordinary people, and right wrongs. </p>

        <p> The show has received recognition as one of Britain's finest television programs, winning the 2006 British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series and five consecutive (2005–2010) awards at the National Television Awards during Russell T Davies's tenure as executive producer. In 2011, Matt Smith became the first Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA Television Award for Best Actor. In 2013, the Peabody Awards honored Doctor Who with an Institutional Peabody "for evolving with technology and the times like nothing else in the known television universe.”  </p>
